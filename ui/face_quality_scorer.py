"""
Face Quality Scorer - Calculate quality metrics for face crops.

Used for representative face selection in the People Tools bulk review workflow.
Higher quality faces make better representatives for person clusters.

Quality Metrics:
- Sharpness: Laplacian variance (focus/blur detection)
- Size: Face crop dimensions (larger = better)
- Frontality: Estimated from landmarks (if available)
- Brightness: Avoid over/under exposed faces
- Recency: Prefer recent photos (slight bonus)
