class BaseSection(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for accordion sidebar sections.

    All sections (Folders, Dates, Videos, etc.) must implement this interface
    to ensure consistent behavior and enable independent testing.

    Responsibilities:
    - Load data from database in background thread
    - Emit signals with loaded data
    - Handle project switching
    - Track generation for staleness checking
    - Manage thread-safe database access

    Each section should:
    1. Create per-thread database instances (thread-safe)
    2. Use generation tokens to discard stale results
    3. Emit signals for UI updates (thread-safe Qt signals)
    4. Clean up resources properly

        Load section data from database (async).

        Implementation Requirements:
        - Increment generation counter
        - Start background worker thread
        - Query database with per-thread ReferenceDB instance
        - Emit loaded signal with generation number
        - Handle errors gracefully

        Thread Safety:
        - Create ReferenceDB() instance inside worker thread
        - Use try/finally to ensure cleanup
        - Emit signals with Qt.QueuedConnection (default for cross-thread)

        Example:
            def load_section(self):
                self._generation += 1
                current_gen = self._generation
                self._loading = True

                        data = db.query(...)
                        self.dataLoaded.emit(current_gen, data)
                    finally:
