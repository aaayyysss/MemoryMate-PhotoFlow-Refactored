Face Quality Analyzer

Provides comprehensive quality metrics for face images to enable:
- Better representative face selection
- Quality-based filtering
- Clustering quality assessment
- User insights into face detection quality

Metrics:
1. Blur Detection (Laplacian variance)
2. Lighting Quality (histogram analysis)
3. Face Size/Resolution scoring
4. Aspect Ratio validation
5. Multi-factor quality score
