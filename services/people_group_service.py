# services/people_group_service.py
# Version 2.0.0 dated 20260215
# Service for managing People Groups feature
#
# People Groups allow users to define groups of 2+ people and find photos
# where those people appear together (AND mode) or within a time window.
#
# Fix 2026-02-15: Rewritten to use canonical schema from schema.py
# - Removed non-existent columns: group_key, display_name, description, icon
# - Removed non-existent tables: person_group_state, person_group_matches
# - Uses group_asset_matches for match results
# - Uses name instead of display_name

"""
PeopleGroupService - Groups of people for finding photos together

Based on best practices from Google Photos, Apple Photos, and Adobe Lightroom.
Provides:
- Group CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Member management (add/remove people from groups)
- Match computation (Together AND, Event Window modes)
- Results stored in group_asset_matches table

Key Design Decisions:
1. Per-project scoped groups (not global)
2. Precomputed/cached results in group_asset_matches
3. Background computation with progress signals
