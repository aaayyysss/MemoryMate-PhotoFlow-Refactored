## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-22

### Industrial-Grade Face Pipeline & Bootstrap Policy

Final comprehensive overhaul of the face processing stack, eliminating filtering bottlenecks and ensuring maximum recall for screenshots and group photos.

#### Face Detection
- **FaceDetectionWorker**:
  - **Zero Truncation**: Eliminated the per-screenshot face cap for `include_cluster` mode (previously 14-18), allowing all detected faces (e.g., 20+ in dense collages) to reach the database.
  - **Always-on Classification**: Mandatory screenshot classification regardless of policy ensures consistent behavior across all modes.
  - **Policy-aware Caps**: Retained tiered limits for standard modes: `exclude` (0), `detect_only` (4).

#### Face Clustering
- **FaceClusterWorker**:
  - **Zero-drop Small Face Policy**: Fully disabled small-face dropping in `include_cluster` mode. Faces are no longer filtered by area ratio, ensuring small background faces in screenshots are clustered.
  - **Very Aggressive Merge Bias**: Increased DBSCAN epsilon to 0.70 for screenshot-inclusive runs to combat over-fragmentation and ensure noisy social media faces are grouped effectively.
  - **Lexicon Expansion**: Added international markers (bildschirmfoto, 스크린샷, etc.) to the clustering-side screenshot detector for localized OS support.
  - **Accounting Granularity**: Implemented class-level `_skip_stats` to track specific attrition reasons (bad_dim, low_conf, small_face_screenshot).

#### Face Pipeline
- **FacePipelineWorker**:
  - **Enhanced Accounting**: Final `FACE_ACCOUNTING` summary now exposes full attrition (detected -> DB -> loaded -> dropped) including screenshot-specific skip statistics.
  - **Policy Consistency**: Guaranteed that interim clustering passes strictly adhere to the user's active screenshot policy.

#### Project Management & Reliability
- **Bootstrap Policy**: Implemented canonical startup selection (Last-used -> Single existing -> Onboarding/Selection state) in `main_window_qt.py`.
- **Model Intelligence**: `ProjectRepository` now automatically selects the highest-tier CLIP model available (Large > B16 > B32) for new projects.
- **UI Feedback**: Added "Model Upgrade Assistant" tooltip and a clearer explanation of screenshot clustering behavior in the scope dialog.
