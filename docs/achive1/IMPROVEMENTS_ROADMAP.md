- ✅ Fixed silent image load failures with proper error tracking
- ✅ Added EXIF orientation correction for face thumbnails
- ✅ Increased face thumbnail sizes (128→192 in dialog, 64→96 in sidebar)
- ✅ Fixed AttributeError crash in cluster status polling
- ✅ Removed corrupted status file blocking progress pollers

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ Fixed people section count display (now shows total faces)
- ✅ Unified thumbnail grid spacing (consistent 8px padding)
- ✅ Enhanced face visibility with larger thumbnails
- ✅ Added proper EXIF auto-rotation for all face displays
- ✅ Removed deprecated code causing "Unable to display thumbnails" warnings
- ✅ **NEW:** Created dedicated PeopleListView widget with Apple-style design (2025-11-17)
  - Large circular face thumbnails (96x96 px) in tabs mode
  - Circular face thumbnails (32x32 px) in list mode sidebar tree
  - Hover effects and rounded selection styling
  - Integrated search filtering
  - Status bar updates on person activation
  - EXIF orientation correction for all face thumbnails
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code architecture
  - Consistent styling across both UI modes

### 3. Deployment & Packaging (NEW - 2025-11-17)
- ✅ Created PyInstaller spec file with ML model bundling
- ✅ Added runtime hook for InsightFace model path resolution
- ✅ Enhanced face detection service for PyInstaller bundle support
- ✅ Created model download helper script
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment documentation (DEPLOYMENT.md)
- ✅ Support for deployment on PCs without Python

## 🔄 In Progress / Next Steps

### 1. Face Detection Pipeline (High Priority)
**Status:** Needs testing with latest fixes

**Remaining Issues:**
- Some photos still showing corrupt/unsupported errors
- Need to verify all 2091 detected faces now save properly
- Clustering needs re-run with fixed embeddings

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Clear face_crops table and re-run detection on all photos
- [ ] Monitor for any RGBA conversion errors (should be 0)
- [ ] Verify all 2091 faces generate embeddings
- [ ] Run clustering to create person groups
- [ ] Validate People section shows all faces

### 2. Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)
**Current Bottlenecks:**
- Face detection runs synchronously (blocks UI)
- No progress indication for long-running operations
- Thumbnail loading can be slow on large libraries

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add progress dialog for face detection worker
- [ ] Implement incremental face detection (process new photos only)
- [ ] Add thumbnail cache prewarming
- [ ] Optimize database queries for large datasets

### 3. User Experience Enhancements (Medium Priority)
**Identified Improvements:**
- People section needs better organization
- No way to manually add/remove faces from clusters
- Missing bulk operations (delete multiple, merge multiple)
- Search functionality could be enhanced

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add "Edit Person" dialog with face management
- [ ] Implement face selection for manual clustering
- [ ] Add bulk operations toolbar
- [ ] Enhance search with fuzzy matching
- [ ] Add sorting options (by name, by count, by date)

### 4. Error Handling & Logging (Low Priority)
**Current State:**
- Good error logging now in place
- Status messages are clear
- Need better user-facing error recovery

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add "Retry Failed Images" button
- [ ] Create error report dialog showing failed images
- [ ] Add diagnostic export for bug reports
- [ ] Implement automatic error recovery

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical
- None currently identified

### Medium
- ✅ Status directory needs to be in .gitignore (FIXED - commit f64e98d)
- [ ] Face crops directory can grow large (no cleanup)
- [ ] No limit on max faces per cluster

### Low
- [ ] Thumbnail spacing setting not in preferences UI
- [ ] Some EXIF orientations might still display incorrectly
- [ ] Progress pollers create empty status files

## 💡 Feature Requests

### Face Detection
- [ ] Support for multiple face detection models
- [ ] Adjustable detection sensitivity
- [ ] Face quality filtering (blur detection)
- [ ] Age/gender estimation (optional)

### People Management
- [ ] Face tagging with names
- [ ] Favorite people quick access
- [ ] Hide/ignore specific clusters
- [ ] Export person albums

### UI/UX
- [ ] Drag & drop to merge people
- [ ] Visual similarity indicator
- [ ] Timeline view for person photos
- [ ] Grid vs List view toggle

### Performance
- [ ] GPU acceleration for face detection
- [ ] Distributed processing (process on multiple machines)
- [ ] Smart caching strategies
- [ ] Background processing mode

## 📊 Metrics & Goals

### Current Status (Estimated)
- Face Detection Accuracy: ~90%
- Face Clustering Accuracy: ~85%
- Processing Speed: ~2-3 photos/sec
- User Satisfaction: High (after recent fixes)

### Target Goals (Q1 2026)
- Face Detection Accuracy: >95%
- Face Clustering Accuracy: >90%
- Processing Speed: >5 photos/sec
- Zero critical bugs
- < 1% data loss

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Consolidate thumbnail loading code (duplicated in 3 places)
- [ ] Refactor sidebar tab system (too many similar methods)
- [ ] Extract face thumbnail rendering to shared component
- [ ] Add type hints to all face detection code

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for RGBA conversion
- [ ] Add integration tests for face pipeline
- [ ] Add regression tests for fixed bugs
- [ ] Create test dataset with various image formats

### Documentation
- [ ] Document face detection configuration
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create developer setup guide
- [ ] Document database schema changes
